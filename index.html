        <h1>Cool Stuff to Do Around Provo</h1>
        <p>Are you bored in Provo? Select a category for info on lots of activities in Provo and surrounding areas!</p>
        
        <!-- Idea:
        Make an informative webpage about cool stuff to do around provo/utah valley: 
         - make it interactive so users can add their own ideas too - this is perfect for Angular!
         - lots of cool pictures, maybe some maps if we can get google maps api to work 
         - just a nice dynamic list of cool activities, like outdoors (climbing), indoors (center st), etc

        <!-- 
        Are we planning on hard coding the activities?
        Are we just going to pull pictures from a google api?
        What kind of layout do we want to have?
